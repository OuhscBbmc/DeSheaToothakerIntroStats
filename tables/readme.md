Tables
================
## of *Introductory Statistics for the Health Sciences*, by Lise DeShea and Larry E. Toothaker

This folder contains the [R](http://www.r-project.org/) code to reproduce the book's tablers. 

 * The `*.md` file is the most useful for browsing the tables produced by the R code.
 * The `*.R` file contains the important code that actually constructs the tables.
 * The `*.Rmd` file executes the R file and packages the results as a report (in two formats: md & html).
 * The `*.html` file is the second format of the chapter report.  Clicking on the file within GitHub will display the raw html, which will not be useful to most readers.  However, the raw html can be downloaded and saved as a stand-alone file if the contents need to be viewed on a machine without constant internet access.
 * The `*.csv` files were sent to the [publisher](https://www.crcpress.com/Introductory-Statistics-for-the-Health-Sciences/DeShea-Toothaker/9781466565333) to typeset into the beautiful tables you see in the book.  The csv files may not be useful to most readers.
