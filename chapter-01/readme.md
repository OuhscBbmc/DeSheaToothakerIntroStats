Chapter 01

## of *Introductory Statistics for the Health Sciences*, by Lise DeShea and Larry E. Toothaker

This folder contains the [Inkscape SVG](http://www.inkscape.org/en/) code to reproduce the chapter's figures used in our book. Chapters 1 and 15 contain only figures (no data graphs), so their contents are a little different from Chapters 2-14.

 * The `*.md` file is the most useful for browsing the chapter's contents.  It displays all the loose figures in a single page.
 * The `*.html` file is the second format of the chapter report.  Clicking on the file within GitHub will display the raw html, which will not be useful to most readers.  However, the raw html can be downloaded and saved as a stand-alone file if the contents need to be viewed on a machine without constant internet access.
 * The `*.svg` files specify the design of the figures.  These text files will not be useful to most readers.
 * The `*.pdf` files are used by the [book publisher](https://www.crcpress.com/Introductory-Statistics-for-the-Health-Sciences/DeShea-Toothaker/9781466565333).  These files will not be useful to most readers.
