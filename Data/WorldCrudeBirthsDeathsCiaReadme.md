Information about the World Crude Birth and Death Rates Data
================
## *Introductory Statistics for the Health Sciences*, by Lise DeShea and Larry E. Toothaker

### Background
The purpose of this document is to provide background on the data set on world crude birth rates and crude death rates.  The data came from the following sources:

* World Factbook (2013).  Crude birth rates per 1,000 population in 2012.  Washington, D.C.:  Central Intelligence Agency.  Retrieved from:  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ 
* World Factbook (2013).  Crude death rates per 1,000 population in 2012.  Washington, D.C.:  Central Intelligence Agency.  Retrieved from:  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ 

The World Factbook defines the crude birth rate as the number of births during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; and the crude death rate as the number of deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear.  DeShea & Toothaker combined the data for an example in Chapter 5. 

### Dataset Variables
