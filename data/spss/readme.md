SPSS Datasets
================
## for *Introductory Statistics for the Health Sciences*, by Lise DeShea and Larry E. Toothaker

This folder contains SPSS datasets used in our book.  For information about each dataset, please navigate up one level to the [Data directory](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/DeSheaToothakerIntroStats/blob/master/data).  In that directory, click on the appropriate 'Readme' file.  For instance, documentation for the `parkinson-walking` dataset is found in `parkinson-walkingReadme.md`.

For documentation applicable to all datasets, please see the Readme file visible towards the bottom of the `Data/` directory at https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/DeSheaToothakerIntroStats/blob/master/data.  Please share any comments you have (or possible errors you see) with [Lise DeShea](http://nursing.ouhsc.edu/Research/meet-our-team.cfm).
