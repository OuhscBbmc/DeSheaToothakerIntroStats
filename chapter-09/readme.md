Chapter 09
================
## of *Introductory Statistics for the Health Sciences*, by Lise DeShea and Larry E. Toothaker

This folder contains the [R](http://www.r-project.org/) code to reproduce the chapter's analyses and graphs datasets used in our book. 

 * The `*.md` file is the most useful for browsing the chapter's contents.  It displays the results of the R code.
 * The `*.R` file contains the important code that actually runs the analyses and constructs the graphs.
 * The `*.Rmd` file executes the R file and packages the results as a report (in two formats: md & html).
 * The `*.html` file is the second format of the chapter report.  Clicking on the file within GitHub will display the raw html, which will not be useful to most readers.  However, the raw html can be downloaded and saved as a stand-alone file if the contents need to be viewed on a machine without constant internet access.
 * The `figure-pdf/` and `figure-png/` directories contain the stand-alone graphics files used by the [book publisher](https://www.crcpress.com/Introductory-Statistics-for-the-Health-Sciences/DeShea-Toothaker/9781466565333).  These files will not be useful to most readers.

For documentation about a dataset (in either a csv, SAS, or SPSS format), please see the readme file visible toward the bottom of the [`data/`](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/DeSheaToothakerIntroStats/blob/master/data) directory.  Please share any comments you have (or possible errors you see) with [Lise DeShea](http://nursing.ouhsc.edu/AboutTheCollege/Research/MeetourResearchTeam.aspx).
